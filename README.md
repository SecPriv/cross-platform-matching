# Cross-Platform App Matching

This repository contains the code from the 2024 MSR Paper "Comparing Apples to Androids: Discovery, Retrieval, and Matching of iOS and Android Apps for Cross-Platform Analyses" by Magdalena Steinb√∂ck, Jakob Bleier, Mikka Rainer, Tobias Urban, Christine Utz, and Martina Lindorfer. 

We're currently documenting our analysis pipeline and setup. Soon we will publish the code to:
    - scrape store information
    - download apps
    - extract features for matching
    - match apps

Additionally, we make available:
    - the full list of matches produced for our paper
    - the full list of reference pairs we collected
